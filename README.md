# ⚡ **Voltage Underscaling CNN Accelerator Project**  

## 📌 **Description**.  
This project investigates how to **reduce the power consumption** of **CNN accelerators** using the **Voltage Underscaling** technique. This allows the accelerator to consume less power while maintaining the accuracy of the neural network, even in the presence of permanent memory faults.

### 🔹 **Project characteristics**.  
- ✔️ Simulation of the impact of **Voltage Underscaling** on different CNN architectures (AlexNet,Densenet,MobileNet,SqueezNet,VGG16, VGG19,ZFNet, ResNet, Inception, Xception).  
- ✔️ Modelling of **permanent memory faults** and their impact on CNN inference.  
- ✔️ Implementation of **error mitigation** techniques to maintain accuracy.  
- ✔️ Comparison of **energy consumption** before and after optimisation.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Here's an overview of how this repository is organized. Each directory is designed to contain specific aspects of the project, facilitating navigation and understanding of the work performed.

* 📁 **`MoRS_análisis_modelos/`**: This directory is intended for [ results and analysis of MoRS models, performance metrics, and visualizations.]
* 🧠 **`Redes_Cifar_Colorectal_Imagenette/`**: Contains the code and resources related to training and evaluating neural networks specifically for the Cifar, Colorectal, and Imagenette datasets.
* 💻 **`Redes_iniciales_Colorectal/`**: This directory houses the initial implementations of neural networks applied to colorectal data, including configurations and training scripts.
* 📈 **`Resultados_Modelos_Mors/`**: Here, raw and processed results generated from the execution of MoRS models are stored.
